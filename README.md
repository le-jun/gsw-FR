# gsw-FR

List of ̣~1000 common french words and their [Alsatian dialect translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsatian_dialect) (`gsw` ISO 639-3). Feel free to use it in any way you like, in accordance to the GPL-3.0.

# Content structure

The csv file contains words compiled from multiple sources and is structured by 5 fields:

* fraSing – Singular form in french
* gswSing – Singular form in alsatian
* gswPlu – plural form in alsatian
* articleSing – singular gender article in alsatian
* theme – word arbitrary theme for classification

# To Do

An IPA table has been added for a future "gswIPA" additional field. Doing it manually would be tedious and I’m looking for a way to automate the process.

# Completion

As any "living" language, this list is but a snippet and there are many more including new words and regional variations. On that matter, words were arbitrarly compiled from many sources without regard to regional variations and may thus be lack uniformity. If you have any experience on that matter, feel free to contribute by adding words, fields or anything you deem interesting.
